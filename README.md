#Welcome to Drigrow's repo

**INTRO:**

This is a repo to store my js code used in deploying services on cloudflare workers. Most of them are modified from its original template and i add userinterface(ui) and interactions myself. ALso there are some for my server like urlrewrite which used for re-write url so no .html suffix is needed.

**NOTICE:**

You feel free to use or modify any of the code in this repo but not for commercial use (you can generate similar code using cloudflare template w/microsoft copilot). 

**HOW TO USE:**

Simply create a worker in cloudflare dashboard and copy the js file by "edit code" choice shown on project deployed page. You can create a template worker script and the copy mine into it too, then the file name will match(index.js instead of worker.js).

p.s. Some of the files have \<link rel="icon" href="https://drigrowpersonal.eu.org/favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon"\> in html zone that its my icon, if you'd like to clear it, delete the \<link\> lable.
